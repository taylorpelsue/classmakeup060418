****OVERALL SUMMARY****
In this class, we are introduced to ES5. My overall takeaway is that it's kind of like a new way of thinking about JavaScript. We discussed adding template- literals, which is a new way of concatinating strings, and we learned about CONST. Const is kind of like setting up a variable, but it can not be changed. Using template- literals and const(s) also seem to improve code readability and help keep code DRY. We were introduced to arrow functions, which the syntax is : (argument) => (what gets returned). We were then shown ES6 destructuring, which helps reduce redundant code.
